This repository contains the code and notebooks for the Volatility Forecasting Challenge. The goal of this challenge is to develop a comprehensive trading strategy that leverages volatility predictions for selected stocks.

Problem Description: Build a Volatility Forecasting Model: Develop a model in Python for forecasting the future volatility of stocks. You can choose the modelling technique that aligns with your strategy - Utilise historical daily stock price data for the top 20 stocks by market capitalisation on the NSE.

This challenge is divided into four key parts:

Volatility Forecasting Model:
Develop a Python model to predict the future volatility of stocks.
Choose any modelling technique that best suits your approach (e.g., GARCH, Machine Learning).
Utilize historical daily stock price data for the top 20 stocks by market capitalization on the NSE.

Volatility Forecasting:
Implement your chosen model to predict future volatility for each selected stock.
Ensure your model provides reliable estimates over a rational forecast horizon.

Trading Strategy:
Formulate a trading strategy based on the predicted volatility.
The strategy should capitalize on changes in volatility, adjusting positions accordingly.
Implement the strategy in a Jupyter Notebook.

Backtesting:
Backtest your trading strategy using historical data from August 2018 to August 2023.
Evaluate the strategy's performance against the selected stocks.
Consider transaction costs and other relevant factors in your evaluation.

Visualisations and Results:
Generate visualizations to illustrate:
Predicted volatility
Trading signals generated by your strategy
Performance of your strategy
Present your results clearly and concisely within the Jupyter Notebook.
